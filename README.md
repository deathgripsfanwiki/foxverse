# foxverse
A replacement service for the now discontinued Miiverse service. (currently 3DS exclusive)

# Why is this 3DS exclusive?
I have not added Wii U support currently, I do not own this console so its impossible for me to give support to something I don't own. However I will accept PRs to get Wii U support added.

# How do I set this up?
You don't for now.
